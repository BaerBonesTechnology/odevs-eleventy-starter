<h2>Topics we cover</h2>

<h2>Event format</h2>

<p>Our events are pretty casual and informal. At each event we usually hold two full talks, which are around 20-minutes long. Then afterwards, we hold a few lightning talks afterwards that are 5-minutes long.</p>
<h3>Why lightning talks at the end?</h3>

<p>As a tradition we hold a few spontaneous 5-minute long lightning talks at the end of each meetup. Our goal is to make public speaking as accessible as possible, and lightning talks are a great way to get started with it.</p>

<p>We work hard to help you overcome any fears related to public speaking. At the end of the day, we're all friends and you trust us to support your career growth with great, constructive feedback; or a simple tap on your shoulder letting you know you did a great job.</p>
<h3>From the community, to the community</h3>

<p>From the beginning, we always wanted this meetup to reflect what the community wants. That's why we always encourage our members to message us to suggest topics or propose talks.</p>
