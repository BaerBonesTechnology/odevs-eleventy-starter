Join your fellow Orlando Developers for two great sessions to learn about making better estimations and using data to drive our decisions.

Software Estimating in an Imperfect World
Although there are many well documented processes for estimation, many teams struggle mightily with this process leading to a lot of frustration, mistrust and blown delivery dates! This talk will take a look at some of the reasons why this happens as well as some techniques and tips on how to best deal with them when they do.

Data-Driven Software Engineering
Software engineers --- like surgeons before the 20th century --- often make decisions based on gut and heuristics. The results are often as gruesome for software engineers as they were for surgeons before they started grounding their practice in the data-driven science of medicine. I propose a more data-driven approach for answering these questions, an approach that will make software engineers more like effective, modern surgeons than the old, butchering surgeons of the 19th century.
