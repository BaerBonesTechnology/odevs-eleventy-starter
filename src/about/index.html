We are the Orlando Devs, a community of software developers in Orlando who are life-long learners and love being around like-minded people all day.<br><br>
We do that by hanging out on the <a href="/slack" class="underline hover:text-tPalette3"> Orlando Devs Slack channel</a> every day, and by going to multiple meetups throughout the month. We even have <a href="/meetup" class="underline hover:text-tPalette3">our own monthly meetup</a> where we cover a wide array of topics that are related to software development.
